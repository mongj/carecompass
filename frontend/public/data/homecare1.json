Through AIC,  we were contacted by HNF physiotherapist Kyi Kyi for my brother’s weekly home-based physio sessions.  She is very patient, encouraging and  respectful towards my brother.  She even borrowed from one of her patients a leg exercise machine for my brother to try before we buy online.  Also helped us to arrange HNF healthcare colleague to do assessment for the Disability scheme, SG Enable Carpark Label for Passengers with Mobility Impairment and referred him to St Luke Eldercare for his future physio sessions.\n\nHNF is a one-stop all-round service provider who brings care into the homes of patient.  Their comprehensive range of services make it easier for  caregivers to tap on.  We appreciate their service.",

It's truly heartwarming to witness the bond he has formed with them over time, a testament to the caring and supportive environment they have cultivated. Dad's enthusiasm for these visits speaks volumes about the positive impact they have on his well-being and sense of belonging. He often shares stories about his interactions with the staff, highlighting the kindness and compassion they consistently demonstrate. In many ways, Care Corner has become a second home for Dad, a place where he feels welcomed, understood, and valued. We are immensely grateful for the unwavering support and care he receives from the entire team. Thank you!",

Last night I had blood in my stool and pain in my anus when I was using toilet. That’s why I was worried and decided to see doctor. As I am foreign worker and  have to go SATA appointed by company , to get medical consultation for my heath issue. I went there and met the doctor. I am not sure what is her name and her room no is room 11.\nShe asked me what happened and what did you eat . Okay that’s normal things when we meet with doctors. I told her what I ate and\nwhat happened to me last night. She asked me how many litters of water you drink per day and did you do my exercise? I told her I drink 2-3 L per day and I exercise as well. She asked what kind of exercise did you do? I said light cardio and yoga .Then\nShe checked my butt and situation. I was worried that I am having a hemorrhoids . As I can feel something that come out from my anus.\nShe just check and never told me properly why I  am having this problems.\nI asked her what should I do should I do more exercise ? she said I aldy asked you like did you do exercise or not so my answer is there . And gave me one liquid that will help for constipation.\nWe need doctors for our worries about our health if we can solve ourselves why should we go the clinics ? Please be professional and treat your patient with abit care and kind . That’s doctors should do for people health.\nI am sure that I won’t go there again for my sickness or other health problems expect medical check test appointed my company.\nIn this case, I will go other clinics and seek advice for my problem.\nI asked her to give me medical certificate as I couldn’t go back to work as the time is about 12:30 pm. Okay I understand that you can’t give me as I am not sick . But she  can tell me easily way right? when I go and ask her she said can’t give and asked me to leave from her room with rude way.\nFor those who are reading my review, PLEASE DO NOT GO THERE TO SEEK YOUR MEDICAL ADVICE. Health is important to us hence please go to clinic which have professional doctors and good doctors.\nI didn’t come as I want to get fake MC, I came as I am worry about my health I just want to check whether I am having hemorrhoids or not and I  wanted to know how to avoid that.",

        "content": "Went to SATA today for Colour Vision Test for Application to Singapore Poly. Waiting time was over 1 hour, but I was fine with this. Only can say that the staff at the queue counter was polite and understanding. After my number is called, I went to the registration part. I said that all I needed was to complete the form and get it signed. She was unsure and said 'let me check' and went to ask other colleague. Came back later and say this 'this one need doctor'. I didn't think much and just said oh ok. Later i got called up and went. The person gave me colour vision test and visual acuity test. After finish she told me to go to the counter to pay, I checked the form and found out that she only filled up the section for (with artificial aids) and did not fill up section for (without artificial aids) so I went back and told them. After that, it was done and told me to go to pay. I went to the payment there and they checked the form and said needed signature so i went back to the person testing me for the 3rd time. Since she's testing other people, i waited and waited and one other colleague ask me whats the problem and i said no signature and she saw my form and said this one wait for number to get called then go sign. So my number got called and I went in to room 11. The person told me to sit down and i gave her the form. All she did was sign the form and stamp the form (even though she was not the person who tested me) and done. After I went to payment, The person said $55.90. I was shocked, I read lots of experience from other people and they said is was 10+ or 20+. I even gave my Blue CHAS Card and only got 10% discount. And I have no choice but to just pay. After I got the receipt, I was there was a section for Medical Consultation for $28??? So you're telling me I am paying $28 for one little stamp and signature from a person who did not even test me??? There was no consultation involved and no consultation was even necessary. One of the most horrible experience ever. $28 gone in 2 minutes for stamping and signature. If you are going for colour vision test for poly, REMEMBER!!! TELL THEM YOU DO NOT NEED AND DO NOT WANT A DOCTOR/MEDICAL CONSULTATION!",

        "content": "I didn’t plan to write a review but after writing in to management with my heartfelt feedback and only receiving a short canned response, I felt it was warranted.\n\nI engaged CK for my terminally ill grandma who also has dementia symptoms. The carer, Angeline, quit on her 2nd day after my grandma criticised her for putting on a BP monitor cuff wrongly. While I know it must have been unpleasant for Angeline to face that, the fact that she quit so easily after just 1 or 2 statements from an elderly person with dementia makes me feel that she wasn’t well trained and unsuitable for this job. Not to make excuses for my grandma, but this is expected behaviour from dementia patients and Angeline was briefed about this beforehand.\n\nAlso, despite giving a weeks notice the scheduling of the carers is left to the very last minute, literally the night before the carer is meant to come in and this is not communicated clearly and transparently to the client unless you specifically ask about it. When I mentioned that I should’ve been informed if there is no confirmed carer so that I can make other arrangements, Nurse Joon (who was in charge of carer allocation and scheduling) raised her voice at me over the phone, told me it is not her fault as she has been busy, and that if she is unable to allocate a carer it is our own responsibility as family members to care for my grandma. To me this shows a lack of sympathy towards clients and our needs. It is precisely because we as family know we are unable to meet the needs of my grandma that we engaged your services so to suggest that we need to take more responsibility is baffling to me. Furthermore, how are we supposed to take leave or arrange to work from home if you only inform us the night before?\n\nIt’s because of this very regretful experience that I am leaving a public review and due to the fact that they made our lives tougher during an already tough time when they were supposed to provide assistance. Unless huge improvements are made to the company’s SOP and service attitude I would recommend against engaging their services.",

        "content": "THINK TWICE BEFORE ENGAGE COMFORT KEEPERS (NOBLE CARE PTE LTD)\n\nI engaged comfort keepers to provide caregiver service to my dad. I have listed out all the requirements to Joon (the PIC of the company) and I highlighted the most importantant thing is need to perform suctioning of Phlegm to my dad through mouth.\n\nJoon told me that she will send the caregiver (we named it as Amy*) to the hospital (which my dad was staying) for a REFRESH course of the suctioning skill. After two time of lessons, Amy is still not very confident to do. I believed that the more frequent you do, the skill will be improved. So I decided to give Amy a chance.\n*** At the later part, which when Amy came to my house, she told me she only did one time suctioning before that happened 5 years ago. This is totally different from what Joon told me. GOSH!!\n\nAfter my dad discharge, Joon came to my house to do a house assessment before the service start. I double check with Joon, as Amy is very small in size and close to  60years old, will she be  suitable to take care of my dad alone (eg: turning my dad around, etc). Joon replied with everything ok and no issue.\n\nWell, the nightmare started. The first 3 days, Amy still can’t do well on suctioning part and I can’t leave the house for work, as I need to be around to watch her do.\n\nAfter the first week, I feedback to Joon, Amy is still not confident in this area (sunctioning of phlegm) and I will still need to guide her. Joon acknowledged my feedback and said will talk to Amy. After Joon talk to Amy, Amy dosent  seem to improve, therefore I decided to close one eye as long as my dad breathing is stable.\n\nHowever, what happened next was, during the official working time, Amy was caught by me through the CCTV a few times that she was sleeping. The guardrail of my dad bed was not close up. It is very dangerous as what if when Amy really fell in deep sleep and my dad fell down from the bed? How?!\n\nI showed the video and feedback to Joon on Amy sleeping issue as it happened again ( I have videos to proof). This has really hit my limit and I decided to end the contact immediately.\n\nThe reason why I engaged comfort keepers services is to help me reduce my burden and can allow me to go out to work peacefully without worrying for my dad. However, this company really disappointed me with their service from the start to the end. On the later part, when I want to terminate the contract and I informed Joon. I shared to Joon on my concern and reason why I choose to terminate the contract early, Joon totally ignored my feedback and message. Joon replied me after one month later and asking me about the payment (I have not settle the payment cause I am waiting for a reasonable reply on the incident happened).\n\nI am not a person who will review a negative feedback, however, comfort keeper really is giving me headache from the start till the end and the service that I have encountered is very disappointing.\n\nPlease reconsider comfort keepers if you intend to ask them provide their service to you. Based on my experience, I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nPs: if the management of comfort keepers is reading this, please review your caregiver and PIC standard. Thank you.",
