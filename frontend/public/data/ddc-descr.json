The \u201cam escort\u201d, Uncle Basari, he\u2019s always jovial and doing the extra miles in many occasions. 1 is reminding me to give my mum medication before he fetches her in the morning. And making sure she\u2019s safe while moving her from my house to the center\n\nThe other is Penny, she\u2019s super patient and gets along well with my mum. She helps to clean n change her when my mum has loose stools or mild diarrhoea. And never have I heard that she complained about such cuz the stools could be very \u201cstink\u201d and sores panty.\n\nYoke Cheng, thanks for reacting to  the finance and billing quickly. This really helps.\nDischarging her from daycare is my last resort but I definitely miss the warmth and patience of each and everyone",

This has made her  stay active in the morning n to a certain extent has improved her mental health.\nI like to thank all the staff for their commitment n outstanding service to my mom n all seniors at the centre. Worthy to mention is Ms Claudine has demonstrated her extra commitment n beyond her call of duty by asking her son n daughter to double up as \"Santa Claus\" n \"God of fortune \" during Christmas n CNY celebrations. In my opinion,  Ms Claudine is an asset to the Toa Payoh East Centre. I will continue to let my mom to  attend the centre.",

I noted it says 8pm on the website. I then explained that I did not know the closing time is 7.45pm and ask if he can make an exception as I drive 45 minutes to be there to drop off something, if visit is no-go. Instead of explaining, he rudely challenged me to share this as he claims the management told me to do so. Sigh!",

He always looks forward to the warm greetings and familiar faces of the dedicated staff, whom he knows not just by sight, but by name and even a bit of their personal stories. It's truly heartwarming to witness the bond he has formed with them over time, a testament to the caring and supportive environment they have cultivated. Dad's enthusiasm for these visits speaks volumes about the positive impact they have on his well-being and sense of belonging. He often shares stories about his interactions with the staff, highlighting the kindness and compassion they consistently demonstrate. In many ways, Care Corner has become a second home for Dad, a place where he feels welcomed, understood, and valued. We are immensely grateful for the unwavering support and care he receives from the entire team. Thank you!",

I personally witnessed instances of inappropriate conduct directed towards recently employed female staff members. This included the exertion of undue pressure for actions that are unequivocally considered unacceptable within a professional healthcare setting.\n\nFurthermore, during visitation hours, I observed Mr. Carlman engaging in unwelcome advances towards female visitors. This behavior involved an invasion of their personal space and attempts to solicit their contact information without their explicit consent. Such actions stand in stark contrast to the established norms of professionalism and care that one rightfully expects from a nursing home facility.\n\nIn light of these observations, it is my strong belief that immediate and thorough action is imperative to address these matters.

        "review_text": "My recent relative experience at sunlove nursing home was nothing short of infuriating, all thanks to the abysmal performance of an enrolled nurse named Carlman cafino nicoyco. To put it bluntly, he is the epitome of incompetence and indifference, and his presence only added to the already distressing environment.\n\nIt's mind-boggling how someone like Carlman cafino nicoyco even made it into the healthcare profession. His lack of care and compassion towards the elderly residents was evident in every interaction. I witnessed him treating them like inconveniences rather than human beings deserving of respect and dignity.\n\nNot only did Carlman cafino nicoyco lack basic empathy, but he also seemed utterly clueless about his responsibilities. Residents were left waiting endlessly for their medications, while he meandered around as if their well-being was of no concern to him. It's infuriating to see someone so careless and unprofessional in a position that requires attentiveness and diligence.\n\nCommunication? Forget about it! Carlman cafino nicoyco couldn't be bothered to keep families informed about their loved ones' conditions or care plans. It was like pulling teeth just to get a simple update. This level of neglect and disregard is simply unacceptable.\n\nI can't fathom how a nursing home could employ someone like Carlman cafino nicoyco, who clearly has no passion for the work he does. He tarnishes the reputation of the entire facility with his laziness and callous attitude.\n\nWhile there were other staff members who tried to make up for Carlman cafino nicoyco shortcomings, it was evident that his negative influence permeated throughout the environment. The fact that this individual is entrusted with the care of vulnerable residents is infuriating and disheartening.\n\nsunlove nursing home needs to take serious action to rectify this situation immediately. The well-being of its residents should be the top priority, and that means weeding out careless and apathetic employees like Carlman cafino nicoyco. It's time for management to step up and ensure that only dedicated and compassionate individuals are entrusted with the care of our loved ones.\n\nIn conclusion, my relatives experience with Carlman cafino nicoyco at sunlove nursing homewas nothing short of a nightmare. I strongly urge others to think twice before considering this facility for their loved ones' care. They deserve better than to be subjected to the negligence and indifference of someone like Carlman cafino nicoyco.",

Recently both my parents\u2019 health deteriorated sharply n the care required for both of them increased considerably, resulting in new demands n anguish in the family. Care center went the extra mile to provide additional support not just to my parents, but also to us a caregivers. They were both physical n emotional support. Both my parents have become difficult customers but the staff at the care center were welcoming, patient n extremely caring. Anna in particular was always on hand to lend advice as well as a warm shoulder, providing advice n offering empathy all at the same time.  She makes me n my family feel we are not alone in our arduous journey. Thank you Anna n all at the day care center who accepted my parents for all their demands tantrums n u reasonable behaviours. \u2764\ufe0f",

There was a vacancy at the centre after 2 months on the waiting list. Mum was initially reluctant to go in the first week. Centre managers Jac and Andrew and nurse Shirlynn are very caring and helpful and have found ways to manage and persuade mum to mingle and enjoy the activities with fellow patients. All other staff are friendly and patient with the seniors. Now, I have no worries about my mum and can focus on my work during the weekdays as I know she is well taken care of by a group of angels.

I witnessed a significant improvement in my husband's skin issue, a testament to their expertise and attentive care. Their commitment to patient comfort is truly touching.\n\nI also want to extend my deep gratitude to the foreign nursing staff. Despite being far from their own families, their care, dedication, and sacrifice are commendable. This selflessness deserves recognition. I hope this serves as an encouragement and recognition for their tireless efforts.\n\nThank you for the excellent care.",

After my centre visit and observation, I find it\u2019s no different between a day care or a dementia day care. Essentially there\u2019s no programme for dementia care specifically though the programme says so.\n\nOn top of that, each \u201cprogramme\u201d only runs 1hour maybe 1.5hours, otherwise is mostly meals and tea break. So I\u2019m paying a lot for not much.\n\nAfter weighing, we decided to take dad to the Active Ageing centre - it\u2019s free, programmes are more interesting and the people running the centre are very invested.\n\nAgain this is my personal and contrary opinion. If cost is a possible issue then do your research well.",

The staff have ensure that I am safe during the day and well taken care of so that my family can have peace while they are at work.\nThe staff at the centre showered me with love and care. At the centre, I got to interact with people than just myself while i am home alone.  Everyday, they will fetch me from my home  to the centre and vice verse.  I also enjoy the various celebration at the centre.\nAs I aged and required diaper and to be fed, the centre has continued to extend their support to me.\nThey are consistent to follow up on my condition through my daughter and looking forward to welcome me back to the Center after i had discharged from the hospital. We have been blessed through their graciousness and kindness.\nIt is beyond word to describe our gratitudes toward the many goods we have received and benefited from your centre.\nThank you very much to your centre, each and every individual staff, who have been supporting and caring for me the past near 4 years.\nYour Center has made my last few years of my journey a memorable one.  Thank you.\n\nWith love.\nSKS\nWritten on behalf of my dad who has completed his journey in Aug 2024.",

The instructors that conducted the class takes a lot of passion and commitment in the one hour session.\nThey vary the exercise routine and always keep the class lively.\nInstructors like Stella are excellent people that keep the group engaged and happy. I look forward to each Thursday to meet up with my fellow friends.\nPersonally , I believe having 2 sessions per week will help us better.\nRegards\nKC Tan",

The home's staff is polite and experienced but what I wish to share is the attitude of the transport staff.\n\nAppointment is made at 12:50pm to 12:55pm to pick up my mum for rehab. The transport came earlier and at 12:44pm, a transport staff with HP number ending with 0692, called my wife saying that they had arrived. On the phone, he sounded extremely impatient and says that we should be waiting downstairs for him instead. My mum was actually ready by then, we helped her to put on her shoes and push her down on her wheelchair within minutes.\n\nNow I wish to know, if you are early, why do you blame us for not knowing you are early? What is the purpose of appointment time then? I brought my mum down with my helper, if you are unhappy, why don't you tell me off in my face? No guts to face a man and can only bully women, old folks and helpers?\n\nNext, when my helper went down to fetch my mum up later on, someone (I cannot confirmed if he is the same person) from the transport team told off my helper and mum saying that he had waited for us for a very long time.\n\nWhat is this? You had made my mum feels bad and keep apologising to me saying that she is not late. What kind of service and attitude is this?\n\nUpdate: The customer service service is prompt and had contacted me to apologise for the unpleasant event. I am also in customer service industry and understand a person wrongdoing does not reflect the entire organization. Keep it up.",

The elders have the opportunity to socialize with each other in the well-ventilated hall, where they can play games or simply chat with each other. All the meals are cooked in house. This place is an excellent option if you want to leave your elderly relatives for a short term stay if you are traveling for work or for any other reason. They provided multiple short- and long-term care options, which really helps take the pressure off families. I would recommend their services.",

From the moment you walk in, you can tell that they genuinely care about their clients and are passionate about providing the best possible care. They are patient, compassionate, and attentive, always going above and beyond to make sure that each and every person in their care feels comfortable and safe.\n\nOne of the things that I appreciate most about this senior day care is their focus on individualised care. They understand that each person with dementia has unique needs and preferences, and they work closely with clients and their families to create personalised care plans that address those needs. Whether it's providing memory stimulation activities or helping with basic activities of daily living, the staff is always attentive to each client's needs.\n\nThe centre is clean, bright, and welcoming, and it's clear that a lot of thought has gone into creating an environment that is both safe and stimulating for people with dementia. They offer a range of activities, including exercise classes, arts and crafts, and music therapy, which help to keep clients engaged and stimulated.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend here to anyone looking for high-quality senior daycare with a focus on dementia care. Their exceptional staff, individualized care plans, and welcoming facilities make them stand out as one of the best in the industry.",

Once, he wanted water and I went to take that from the water dispenser nearby but the nurse stopped me and told me not to take from there. Then, she handed over to me something that looked cloudy to give him to drink. I asked her what is this all about, nothing but the word water came from her mouth.\n\nFood here was as depressing as the environment. Similar menu all time my other family members had told me. Even by watching my grandpa eat, I dreaded living.\n\nSee, this is a home. It should be something that make people comfortable not something that make people anxiously look forward to their last days.",

I was in hospital for 1 month and when i informed them my hospitalization leave is up to x date their reply was if i do not turn up for the the session after my hospitalization leave, I will be charged.

Initially, she was very reluctant, and we had difficulties motivating her to go to the center.\n\nThe team at Dakota did magic and after some weeks of trying, mom now looks forward to going to the center every morning including the weekends! She really enjoys her time at the center and kept asking why the center is not opened on weekends.\n\nThe team at Dakota takes good care of mom, and we feel safe leaving mom in their hands. In addition, the center keeps constant contact with me to ensure we update closely each other on mom's well-being, which I really appreciate.\n\nIn a recent conversation with mom, I asked her: \"If I am obliged to write a compliment letter to the center, is there any staff who takes special attention and care on you, and that you would like me to praise him/her?\"\n\nMom's reply: \"Every staff is nice and takes care of me. You must write a compliment letter to each and every individual staff there.\"\n\nKudos to the team at Dakota!",

Every morning my mum exhibits eagerness to go to the centre, and comes home excited and proud of her own achievements (small treats and prizes won during mini activities) and pretty artworks that she worked on with the help of the staff. It is always heartening to see how well cared for she is both physically and emotionally.\n\nOne incident I wish to highlight in particular occurred on 18 July. My mum had wandered away from home and attempted to navigate to the centre alone instead of waiting for her usual transport and escort to pick her up. One of the centre staff, Ms Cindy, on her way to pick up other elderly spotted my mum looking lost in the nearby environment, and swiftly brought her into safety of the centre and contacted me immediately to assure me that my mum was safe.\n\nWords couldn't fully express the sincere gratitude I feel towards this amazing team, my deepest appreciation to everyone at Punggol South NTUC Health Day Centre for Seniors for always being attentive and their efforts for keeping our elderly safe and happy.",

The doctor was insensitive when delivering the news to my dad that he had only days to live, unlike the doctors at hospitals where they will be kinder to the patients when delivering these news.

I sincerely believe that  her regular participation at your centre had an enormous positive impact on the quality and enjoyment of her final years of life.  After her first few visits, she could not wait to get there each morning.  The gentle caring and professional attention shown to her was always greatly appreciated.  All staff, from the Director to the cleaning staff always exhibited such care and hospitality.  I have visited  many facilities in various countries ( including Australia where the model of care was originally adapted from) and while some other facilities may have more expensive surrounds and  gadgets and possibly more \"certification qualified\"staff, your staff and volunteers constantly demonstrated care of the highest and exceptional quality.  I am sorry to have taken so long to write this but I have only stumbled on this opportunity to thank you publicly when helping a cousin to find support for her mum.\nMay you all be blessed for your compassion and care.\nsincerely, daliah Moss ( Broome, Australia)",

Though the journey with her was rough but your team derived a strategic management plan for her. Not to mention the energy the team had shown.  During the time my mom was there, we learnt a lot too about the do & don't through the interaction with the team.\n\nMost importantly, she was well taken care of these years at your centre. It had been our blessing to have had sent her to your centre. We are not sugar-coating as your centre had helped us tremendously, especially for my father, overcoming the darkest moment in caring for my mother.\n\nThe service that your team has provided to families with PWD(Patient With Dementia) is an integral aspect of the holistic care that cannot be substituted or undermined. Such support means very much to us (families with PWD) although appreciative words are not mentioned often, the gratitude is felt in our hearts. God will bless all of you for persevering in such meaningful but seldom appreciated or spoken job.",

The attending would also call to check with me if there are any issues and as well would sometimes give a report of how my dad is doing.    Dad would would come home with some drawing/coloring and art & crafts and I would know that there are enough program to keep him occupied.

Claimed that family member did not came down to see how their staff doing their job. FYI, i have been there on multiples days & MAJORITY of the time my granny waited about 20-30min for her next exercise.\n\nMost of the elderly are sat there and waiting for their turn (more than 15min wait though).\nSo think twice to send your elderly here for \"exercise\".\n\n& of cos 1st few weeks, family member definitely can see how they take \"good care\" of your elderly. E.G. going into their physio room for 1-to-1 assessment. Months later left them at the table & ROT.\n\nMy granny has been there for a year, & she used the exercise machines less than 5 times. (Start count after I went there with granny recently which is about 1 month ago)\nSo basically 11 months while being there, she has not been touching any machines.",

The 2nd visit I met nurse WaiNa. I felt assured after i observed how she treated the old folks there attending to them with passion just like they were her own parents. She even bother to explain to me about dementia people and what to expect. WaiNa is really a Gem the reason why this place gets a four star despite of other unpleasants incidents with other staff nurse.. Nurse Tusal is also quite nice and patience.  Thank you both of you.",

The kindness and compassion she showed to my father and my family made a world of difference at such a difficult time. She gave us regular updates and all our requests were accomodated with kind understanding. Although I was overseas, she made sure I was there for my father's last breath together with my family via videocall. The skype virtual visits at Peacehaven made it possible for me to see my father everyday. Words can't express our gratitude and thanks to Peacehaven and to their whole team.

Kept myself engaged during lessons, passed with flying colours and worked during breaks.\n\nI went back to my office and guess what? They took the time to FIND and CALL my company's HR to complain that I was late and not paying attention. (I was not, the maximum was showing up 5mins late on the first day since it's was inconveniently located and travelling 1 hour was insufficient for me.)\n\nThis is not Primary School/Kindergarten, everyone is an adult with responsibilities. Try harder, and perhaps target someone who's actually lazing off? ....Maybe not the CEO or a person who can influence where we conduct safety trainings? Nevertheless, blacklisted this company throughout my entire organization (>1000+ Staff).\n\nNow, we get certified elsewhere and it is such a great and enjoyable time with absolutely no drama or childish behaviour.\nTRUST THE BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THE TERRIBLE SERVICE/STAFF. It's definitely an on-going thing if it's been happening for years. We PAY to come here in order to try and help save lives (by volunteer basis), not get a second mother.",

        "review_text": "Last week I went for the standard first aid course. The main trainer was quite good, she was knowledgeable and patient. However, on the last day of practical, myself and another participant were paired with a spectacles wearing trainer named Mr Liu. When I did my CPR on the dummy, he commented that i was too fat and needed to lose weight in order to do the CPR properly. I was shocked as no one had been so rude to me since the SAF army days. Liu continued to berate myself and my fellow attendee, saying how subpar our skills were at CPR and first aid. He then failed us and made us repeat the test on the spot. Another participant who was deemed to be more competent than myself was also not spared from his rudeness, telling him that in a 'real life situation, please don't cause people to die'.\n\nLiu then treated the 3 of us attendees like children, saying that he only allowed us to pass because 'the course was designed this way'. I was too upset and shocked to report him to the chief trainer on the spot. I also did not want to risk failing my first aid course and forfeiting my payment. However, should i need to renew my first aid in 2 years, I am considering to not renew it and just letting the validity expire and retaking it with another organization should trainers like Liu be allowed to teach at St. John. He is the most insulting, demeaning trainer i have met in my whole life who thinks this is the SAF and all we participants wanted was to be given a fair chance to learn without being insulted.\n\nI hope Saint John Singapore looks into this, if not, you guys are going to lose more students in the years to come.",

I brought her to St Luke\u2019s ElderCare Hougang Meadow Centre on 15 Aug 2018.\n\nIn my brief interaction with the day care centre staffs and the feedback from my mom, I gathered that the staff are indeed passionate & caring. We feel a great sense of relief after my mom started attending the day care centre. Within the short span of a week, her mood changed tremendously. She seems much happier and looks forward to going to the centre daily. She kept singing praises of the day care centre staff, saying that they are very caring and show great concern towards the old folks.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Molly and Daniel who are extremely caring and also for providing her safe trips to and from her home. We feel so happy as mom found a second home as well as physical & mental well being.\n\nWe will highly recommend SLEC to old folks.",

She took the trouble to explain to me and my sister about the centre activities before we enrolled my m mom.  When we need to transfer my mom to another centre due to change in circumstances,  she trIed her best to assist and make the transfer process so smooth, that we can proceed with our changed plan.\n\nThe centre ambiance is clean, and organised.\nThe staff are friendly and attentive. they will make sure all patients are engaged in the activities to stimulate their brain.  I would like to specially thanks to Mr Daniel & Mr william,  who always joke with my mom. She likes the good attitude of staff there.\n\nI would not hesitate to recommend this senior care centre to anyone who need this service for their love ones",

        "review_text": "Started in early Feb2022 I admitted my father to the dementia senior day care service at NTUC Health Day Care Jurong Spring. So far my experiences with the Centre's staffs is excellent. The centre manager whom I usually engage with, is patience and always willing to hear and talk to the patient's family members/caregivers. They are very accommodating, helpfully to go some extra miles to help out with my request. As we are requested by the NUH Geri specialist to monitor the blood pressure (BP) of my father so that they can better reassess his medication requirement, the centre is understanding and able to assist us in the matter.  In one particular incident, the staff found that my father's blood pressure shot up to above 200 and I was notified immediately. My sibling was able to immediately react and brought my father to visit the GP for check up. Since then my father is given Valsartan medication to control his blood pressure level. It was a crucial intervention. The team nurse had diligently collected and helped prepare my father's blood pressure data report which will becomes useful to show to the NUH Geri specialist whom the doctor can administer his medical condition. Really grateful to the staffs and thankful of their services.",

Each time we went to fetch her from the day centre, she would be smiling saying her goodbye to the staff. The staff there took very good care of her and made her very happy. They are also very careful when administering medication and I always feel at ease as I'm assure that my mum was in good hands.  Special thanks to staff Stephanie, Suhaila, Wendy, Cecilia, Nurse Joy and a gentlemen who drives the centre's bus (pardon me for not knowing his name).  You all are amazing.

His health have improved greatly both mentally and physically.  Most impt of all, he enjoyed going there.  Hope the centre can conduct more art and craft activities as the elderly enjoy doing and if possible allow to bring home so that they can happily and proudly showed to the family.  It boost up their morales. My father also enjoy the festive celebrations. Well done NTUC, keep it up! Thanks.",

It would also be good to settle the meals for the elderly first. Anyway, you guys have a done a great \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d job for keeping the elderly happy and safe!

The kindness and compassion she showed to my father and my family made a world of difference at such a difficult time. She gave us regular updates and all our requests were accomodated with kind understanding. Although I was overseas, she made sure I was there for my father's last breath together with my family via videocall.

        "review_text": "My mom is a dementia patient and she suffers from depression at the same time. I brought her to St Luke\u2019s ElderCare Hougang Meadow Centre on 15 Aug 2018.\n\nIn my brief interaction with the day care centre staffs and the feedback from my mom, I gathered that the staff are indeed passionate & caring. We feel a great sense of relief after my mom started attending the day care centre. Within the short span of a week, her mood changed tremendously. She seems much happier and looks forward to going to the centre daily. She kept singing praises of the day care centre staff, saying that they are very caring and show great concern towards the old folks.\n\nSpecial mention goes to Molly and Daniel who are extremely caring and also for providing her safe trips to and from her home. We feel so happy as mom found a second home as well as physical & mental well being.\n\nWe will highly recommend SLEC to old folks.",

She took the trouble to explain to me and my sister about the centre activities before we enrolled my m mom.  When we need to transfer my mom to another centre due to change in circumstances,  she trIed her best to assist and make the transfer process so smooth, that we can proceed with our changed plan.\n\nThe centre ambiance is clean, and organised.\nThe staff are friendly and attentive. they will make sure all patients are engaged in the activities to stimulate their brain.  I would like to specially thanks to Mr Daniel & Mr william,  who always joke with my mom. She likes the good attitude of staff there.\n\nI would not hesitate to recommend this senior care centre to anyone who need this service for their love ones",

Their caring and attentive approach ensures he always feels comfortable and well-supported.\n\nThe variety of activities provide him with both mental and physical stimulation. These activities not only keep him mobile but also assist with his rehabilitation exercises, which have been crucial for his condition. I have seen a significant improvement in his mobility and overall well-being since he started attending.\n\nThe time Dad spends at the daycare allows my mum, Grace to recharge and take care of her own needs. We both feel incredibly grateful for the peace of mind knowing he is in such capable and caring hands. Thank you again to the entire team at Orange Valley.",

We were truly impressed with the cosy ambience, clean & well organised environment, the spacious layout and most importantly the warm & friendly staff who attended to us.\nTeam leader Ms Sandy is very dedicated & professional in responding to any of our concerns we raised.  She will make sure her team do their very best to give the family the assurance & confidence that our loved ones will be  well taken care of. Last but not least, the other staff whom I know of is Nurse Hannah, Centre supervisor Mr Chua & the transport team , are all so helpful , responsible & caring.\nReally appreciate & thankful for their kindness & patience given to our loved ones. Managing the centre & taking care of the elderly Is definitely not an easy task,  but they have proven to us a job well done.\nThumbs up to all the staff at NTUC Health Senior Day Care-Heartbeat@Bedok & a Big Thank You on behalf of my family.",

The Centre will continually update my dad\u2019s situation and activity.\nFor family members that looking for Daycare Centre. with Ms. Sandy\u2019s Team, you truly can rest assured your loved ones are well taken care.\n\nIris Lau",
